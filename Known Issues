Purchasing a Mana Potion does not add it to the inventory it does how ever show up
in the Craft Materials Option as Arcane Shield.
Nothing being purchased from the NPC Merchant gets added into the Inventory.
Adding Materials as Admin, adds them to the inventory but potions crashes the game with this message:
    if item_details["type"] == "potion":
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'type'

I do believe this is because of the hardcoded Potion type.
